"""
real world programs can become very huge and obviously
one programmer can never produce an entire product.

it is important that a programmer can use other peoples
code in their own project. this practice focuses on a
very simple case.

task: write program that checks if a number is a palindrome
note: palindrome means that the number is its own mirror.

one easy way to do this is to take the number and flip it.
then check if the flipped number is the same as the original
number.

you have already written a program that finds the mirror of
a number. your task is to "use" your mirroring program as a 
function and use that function to complete this task.

def mirror(num):
    pass # < fill this with the code from your previous task

def main():
    pass # < fill in here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
