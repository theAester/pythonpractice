you get a series of tasks, each of them in an individual python file

at the begnning of each file the description of the task is written
as a long comment explaining what needs to be done and the format of 
the output (if necessary).

within the file there is a short comment that looks like below:
|	
|	# < fill in here
|
this indicates the where you need to write your code.

you may define your own functions, classes, etc. whenever needed.

there may be some pre-existing code in each task that is there to 
make your work easier and sometimes give you a hint. they can 
also serve as practical examples for learning new syntax and methods
of python programming so be sure to read them and understand what
they do before starting to write your own code.

usually, you wouldn't need to change anything in the pre-existing
code but you can do at your own risk.

this is a learning challenge so dont be surprised if you cant solve a
task immediately. as a programmer one of the most valuable skills you 
can learn is "good searching". thats why this tasks set is made in
english. it is highly encouraged for you to do a google search whenever 
youre stuck at a task, when you dont know about a specified algorithm 
and also, whenever you dont understand the meaning of an english word 
within the text. 

below is a list of good and reliable websites that may provide you with
useful answers:

docs.python.org
stackoverflow.com
tutorialspoint.com
medium.com
geeksforgeeks.org
baeldung.com

note: you shouldn't try and search in the mentioned websites by yourself (yet)
instead, do a google search and see if a solution comes up from any of
these websites.

RUNNING CODE:

you need to have python 3 installed, then access your terminal/command prompt
inside this folder. on windows you can hold down shift and right-click on the
folder explorer window(make sure no files are selected) and click on
"start powershell windows here". you can run any python program by typing the
following command in the terminal and hitting enter:
|
|	python3 <filename>.py
|
if the terminal complains that python3 does not exist, try this one:
|
|	python <filename>.py
|
the input of the program(if necessary), must then be typed in the new line

to install python go to https://www.python.org and choose your platform (
windows, mac, linux, ...) under the downloads tab and follow the instructions
from there.

recommendation:
even though you can use any text-editor for python. i recommend you download and
install visual studio code (not visual studio). its free and lightweight and has 
a build in terminal window that you can use to run your code. to open the terminal
press Ctrl+Shift+P.

good luck.
